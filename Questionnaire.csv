[moderately] (https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=moderately&spell=1&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiEm_Pd8_7aAhVB3aQKHfjECYkQBQgmKAA),would have a follow up session a week into placement when people actually know what might be required of them.,,
A few more sessions would have been useful,offer more optional sessions,,more about which outcomes needed to be completed at what stage
" 

While l appreciate that there was a session to introduce or explain how the ePad is managed, l felt that there was more to be explained than what was covered.  The session did not really work very well for me as l did not cope with the pace and taking in of information despite the actual recording of details.. Anyway when l took my time after, l had the feel of it but was not sure of the expectations in answering the questions/tasks to be completed let alone how the levels one, two  and three were to be completed.  It is a shame that l went on to complete stage three because when l queried this the answer l got was not very clear.

I was not sure how my mentor/s should access the information, thanks to a colleague next to my unit who had to guide both the mentor and myself to get to grips with the recordings. This compounded the delay in completing the pebble pad tasks as initially my mentor/s then did not know of the task. The assigned mentor/s in turn had to reassign the duty of mentoring to the team l worked with. The change of mentor/s did not affect me at all.

 ","The task needed more time for students to familiarise then have enough time to ask questions if any, students have different levels of ICT understanding.  The actual team who work directly with the student pebble pad to run through what is expected of the student, not giving answers but just to highlight the areas that need covering and to explain how the stages are completed, i.e one, two and three. An hour session to show students how this is completed such as recording of hours and other areas.",To give just enough information and release the tasks needed in stages to avoid confusion.,"To put information on canvas when it is definitely the information for students to work on, for example l had to print some information for lectures twice a couple of times when information was changed. It is expensive for me to print work and throw away as l do not  have much disposable income."
As an individual I felt prepared using the ePad. Not 100% but about 80%. ,I think there should be more than one session on ePad. A lot of confusion among students would be does this go here or there? We kind of had to interpret what to do.,"Don't give us the option to look in placement 3 tabs if we are only on placement 2. It becomes all to easy for mentors to put things in the wrong section. Also in the skills log for example, one of the criteria mentions dealing with death and dying but would only let you select stage 2 or 3. I've achieved this in my first placement and my mentor felt that she wanted this noted but didn't know where to put it.",
"As prepared as you can be I beleive, it all seems daunting at first and when you have the two sessions on it I felt extremely nervous. However, it all kinda clicks when you actually get on placement ","I think the groups could be a little smaller maybe, because of the noise. People tended to talk away which made it difficult to hear in certain areas when things were being explained. Make it well known about the things on canvas which do step by step guides to do things on pebblepad.","Design is fine, self explanatory ","I personally got on ok, but for future students maybe more step by step guides for all areas of pebblepad and clear messages of what needs to be done so confusion isn't caused when others pass on info "
"At first ePad was a bit confusing, however the more I started to use it the easier it became to understand and it was clear to understand the thing you needed to do for first year","The lectures prepare new students 

- maybe putting something on to see if students can use it correctly ",Make the sections clear and in a better order with the interviews ,The guidance is good and they should be something if you can't get on ePad at first 
"At the start I did't feel that prepared due to having problems with finding and adding my mentors. However, now I feel fairly confident using it. ",Maybe show them an example of another student now this is possible. ,"Maybe have the placements in order, or sections into placement 1,2,3 for example then everything that needs to be signed off for that year under each one rather than together.

 

e.g 
year 1- all year skills log and practice standards

year2- all those years etc",?
averagely prepared,mores Epad sessions targeting each section of epad individually,#NAME?,#NAME?
"Didn't feel prepared at all. We only had a few hours preparation. And the mentors didn't know what to do either. Complaints were not felt quickly enough.

In my opinion pebble pad is the worst thing on this course. Sticking to paper based would have been better. At least with paper you could find what you need when you needed it and you are also not reliant on internet usage. ",More tuition. And maybe even a paper user manual ,I would make things easier to navigate and make things easier to find. At the moment Pebble pad is to much effort to work it is a pointless piece if equipment that needs so much more things put in place to make it workable,"Maybe a link to pebble pad on the dash board so everything is under one device

 "
Fairly prepared however wish information within the Epad was more specific/ catered better to our levels of learning. ,Smaller group sessions with demonstrations of filling an actually document. Then also demonstrations of pebble pad. younger students found it easier however i know a lot of mature students who struggled simply saving each page of pebble pad then wondering where everything had gone. ,Year 1 / 2 / 3 headings which then lead onto placement details/ skills log etc. ,Videos. 
fairly well but still struggled as I'm not confident with using computers.,Practice and use the ePad sessions to ask any questions you may have,Not really sure ,more sessions on the use of ePad 
Fairly well on our side but not on the mentors side,With the tutorial session on it and maybe a quick guide booklet for all the different sections to refer back on ,Make it easier to navigate for the mentors and make it easier to evidence practice standards ,How to evidence standards 
Fairly well prepared.,The preparation for students seemed fine. Personally it was more the mentors that needed training. I was one of the lucky ones in that my mentor had used it before.,None,More clarity on how to document hours and experiences.
"Felt quiet prepared, but more guidance is required in terms of what sheets we are meant to be filling in when doing alternative placement, how many people we are allowed to share it with.",Encourage students to look through pebble pad before they go on placement. Also provide a summary on a PowerPoint on what it is that they need to complete in that particular placement. For example in placement 2 you need to complete 50% of practice standard stage 1. So if student have doubt they could always refer back to this power point. ,"It could be beneficial if paper copies of all the documents on pebble pad was available because sometimes it is very difficult to access computers as  there is limited number of computers.

Also for example if the computer is down if paper copies were available we could still complete the relevant documents required to pass the module. ","A summary for each placement for what it is that we need to complete, how much of each section we need to complete for example, is it 50 % of the practice standard as a whole or 50 % of each sub section within practice standard stage 1. 

Also in practice standard is it compulsory for students to add comments in the  student comment section for every single standard and is it compulsory for our mentors to add comment on each standard or can they just put N/A. Furthermore do we have to evidence each section on practice standard  and what can we use to evidence this. if we can not evidence this do we leave it as saying this has not been evidence or as this item has now been fully evidenced. Also is it compulsory for as justify in the comment section about the evidence. Moreover, what do we if press we are working towards a practice standard, does that mean if will not pass the e-pad."
Good,Make sure you fully understand pebble pad as it's new for mentors too ,By putting the placements in logical order ,
I attended the epad session and tried to familiarise myself with it prior to practice by logging on and navigating myself around it. I do feel more sessions could have been put on for the epad as there is a lot to take in,Adding more epad sessions in ast groups as the two that were available weren't enough especially as it was new to everybody. Maybe the consecutive years could buddy up with those who have had experience with epad,Complete separate everything in a year basis. It was very confusing to look at what was a stage one and what was a stage two. Also all of the pad forms for both of the placements being in the same drop down was confusing as it was easy to enter details on the wrong section.,More guidance for the mentors as many did not even know where to start. As for some it was the first time they had navigated around the actual document. Also advice on how to document attendance.
I did not feel prepared using ePad at all. Also it made it harder that my mentor did not have a clue how to even sign on to ePad.  ,"I believe maybe if more sessions was available for new students to learn ePad, if would make it easier for them to grasp. A students first placement can be daunting enough without having the extra stress of not knowing how to work ePad.  ","I would suggest that ePad to be set out more user friendly. An example : My mentor and I filled placement 2 in placement 3, this was due to the fact that placement 3 was at the top of the list, my mentor and myself had no idea we had done this until my AST pointed this out.  ","I have no issues with this.

I would like to add, I think ePad is a great idea and once I got the hang of using it, it became straightforward to use. However, my mentor and I found it difficult to find a free computer, working on a busy ward, there was only two computers on the entire ward. Maybe the need of more computers on some wards, department are needed. "
"I did not feel very prepared at all, even though i attended all the sessions offered by the university. More guidance was needed.",My suggestion would be to have it a few weeks before placement like a preparation for placement. where we had to complete sections told by the university and add certain hours just to gain knowledge in how to use all the different aspects,It is all good and well having it electronically but several placement areas does struggle to accommodate this. There should be a paper option. The design is ok but maybe install a wizard when you need mini tutorials for how to connect with your mentor and how to tag hours etc.,Mini tasks to complete prior to placement and maybe the ast should also keep a closer eye on things like attendance in case some mentors are to laid back.
I did not feel very well prepared for epad. ,Make sure they are aware of how to use it properly instead of just having an odd session to be shown,Make the layout simpler and make things easier to find ,More support and help 
I didn't feel prepared ,Have more sessions ,To have all information that we need to complete on one page ,"Not having everything spread out on canvas, as it's hard to see what we need to complete. "
I don't think we was given enough time to learn how to use ePad correctly and appropriately.,,,
"I feel confident in using it because once you get use to it, it is easy enough to navigate ",By the same way that the current 1st years have been shown,N/A,None
I feel I was quite prepared but the problem was the mentors not being prepared for it.,More training sessions just before placement.,Needs to be less complicated on the year skill lots and things. May be a fab for year one placement one ECT ,Guidance to help our mentors
"I feel like I was given information on the use of ePad, however still felt uneasy going on a new placement and having to remember the processes of completing things on ePad, for example the attendance record, doing this after each shift and tagging it.",Give them a few sessions to get to grips with it and let them do a 'practice' run.,"Make it a little simpler, tagging attendance wasn't shown clearly in ePad how to do this, you had to remember from the sessions.",Guides on how to tag each thing.
"I feel that although we had sessions to introduce ePad and familiarise ourselves with it, it was still confusing to use once we went away on practice. Mentors were also less prepared for it too.",I don't know. ,I would want it more simpler. especially the recording of hours on practice. at first I struggled to figure out and remember how to do it and yet been told that a lot of students still did it wrong.,canvas had instructions but sometimes they weren't clear. 
I feel that I was somewhat prepared although my mentors had no idea that it existed or what to do.,I'd give them more sessions on how to use it.,I'd give the option of paper or online.,
I feel we were given quite a lot of support and training and once started using was quite easy to figure out.,We were introduced to epad in a lecture well before our training on the computers I feel this would of been more beneficial closer together as by the time it had got to our training what was said In the lecture had been forgotten.,maybe put things in order from top to bottom rather than bottom then top. ,everything that I have needed is already covered accept there the app doesn't work on my phone
I feel we were told a lot about ePad and felt the sessions were very informative.,I would consider giving them an advice booklet about what definetly needs to be completed in the specific placement (checklist).,Maybe only make visible the placement and year we need at the current time to avoid confusion.,A checklist of what we need to have completed in the specific placement we are doing.
I felt a little prepared for this. It took some time to get used to and where to find certain things in it. ,"Possibly the same way as we was prepared but a bit more informative, as it still confused me when using it on placement, and even explaining how to use it to my mentor I found it quite hard to do this, because I was still learning how to use it.",No changes,N/A
I felt comfortable enough to use it and try and work my way through but there was still questions i had during placement.,familiarise yourself with epad plenty of times before placement  ,too many tabs and extra things we dont need ,
"I felt fairly prepared, however we were given a couple of lessons on it and expected to use it live. Most of the Mentors were unaware of how to use it, it felt like we were both learning how to use it together. 

I believe more training and follow up needs to be given to the mentors. ","considering we are the newest students using ePad, sometimes the best ways to learn is by people who are actually using it. I think there might be opportunities of the Nursing 17 students being in lessons with the new students to explain things more as a 1 to 1. Antony did an excellent job in teaching us but sometimes it is better again by someone who is actually using it in practice.","separate the learning outcome practices as they say for year 1, year 2 and year 3 for when some can be signed off, why not put them in a separate page then you are not reading through all of them to find you cannot sign them off yet. Also have an option of even if some to sign off are in the years above being able to still tick it in year 1 if you have managed it. For instance I did last offices for a patient & that is to be signed off further in another year. To evidence it (even though to evidence something is not the most straight forward part to do) you need to reflect it and all i wanted to do is sign it off with my mentor, I wasn't able to find where to do that so I've had to leave it off and add it in my personal statement.",I can;t think of any at the moment. 
"I felt fairly well prepared due to the ePad sessions we had before going on placement and because I spent some time familiarising myself with it. Mentors, however, did not seem well prepared and had difficulty gaining access.","I would prepare students in the same way as we were prepared, but I think it would be helpful if there was an in-depth user guide created covering all aspects of ePad.","Although not specifically to do with the design, I found ePad to be too slow; sometimes my mentor would get impatient and click off the page before it had finished saving, as such the work was not saved and had to be done again. 

By far the greatest problem I had was when the mentor had to untick the release assessor feedback box at the bottom. Many times she forgot to do this and her feedback would not appear on my own ePad. This was particularly stressful at the end of my placement when a lot of information was not appearing and my mentor was not available to rectify it.  It would be much better if unticking this box was not necessary and all the mentor had to do was click save for the feedback to show in students' ePads. 

I did not have any issues with the layout of tabs etc. in ePad. ","I would like a detailed user guide created about how to use ePad.

Although there was information about recording attendance, I did not think there was enough information about recording absences. "
I felt I was quite prepared ,Have an example of one filled in,"It's quite tiresome to navigate around, grouping things in a better order would improve it ","None

I felt I was well prepared to use the ePad.,Practice navigating around pebble pad to get use to it.,Make things clearer for mentors on what they have to do.,
I felt like I had sufficient training and I was well prepared,,,
I felt minimally prepared and completed most of it through trial and error. Would have appreciated in put on content  as well as how as well as explicit instructions on do need to mark as complete do you use not achieved etc,Providing a comprehensive user guide. Examples of what to include how to use the various peovforma documents.,,
I felt ok. However my mentor hadn't had her training before I started placement so wasn't very knowledgeable at 1st,,,
I felt prepared enough but still had problems. ,Smaller groups would be better. ,I was happy with the design but there was a lot of confusing assets. ,What the assets are for and guides on how to use them. Some examples of completed assets would be useful. 
"I felt the preparation time was enough however, with all things that are new it takes a while to get used to how things work.

Having instructions to relate to helped when I needed more guidance.

 ","I would follow the same preparation lines as were made available to myself and also add an extra session for those who were still not feeling confident with e-pad.

I found it very useful to print out information as made available on how to use e-pad as this provided a quick reference tool.",I feel the design of e-pad is fine the way it is and would not wish to make any changes.,I would like to see an easily accessible e-pad guidance section containing clear instructions and contact details of people who can offer further support if any issues arose.
"I felt there was support available, there was sessions on to help understand the ePad system but I felt theses needed to be one group at a time so there was more individual support.","I would go through the ePad with them with the information filled in and an example of someone elses ePad, this would have been helpful for me.","For me personally it would make it much easier to do it all on paper, me and my last mentor found it was difficult to be update in completing my epad, and what she needed to fill out as I couldn't put, for example, sticky tags in the bits she needed to fill out this would have made it easier for her and me, because we both sometimes didn't have access to the internet.",n/a
"I felt very prepared to use the ePad system even though I found the teaching session very long and meant I started to lose concentration during this. Also, when using the system I had to go back and re-watch the youtube videos as I struggled to remember how to do so stuff. 

 

The system was easy enough to navigate. However the issue I had with my community placement was that the wifi in the hospital did not work properly for the first 2-3 weeks of my placement and therefore meant my mentor and me struggled to complete the document until the second half of my placement. Furthermore, finding the time to fill in the document was difficult as we were vey busy and my mentors stated that it would have been easier on paper as you could just flick through the document and do bits at a time, this was not possible with the online system. 

Overall, I prefer things on paper and this would have meant a lot less stress for me and my mentor. ",Still have the sessions but maybe make them shorter and have them closer to starting placement so they do not forgot. Still upload the videos to canvas for extra support and help. ,"Ensure that not all practice standards from all 3 years are listed as having to be completed in stage 1. 

Make it clearly for mentors the different placement documents so they do not fill out the wrong set for that placement. ","How to upload testimonies to the document. 

Guidance videos for mentors to use in placement need to be uploaded somewhere for them to refer to when filling out the documents as some struggled. "
"I felt well prepared. All the sessions were very useful, but like with everything new I needed to familiarise myself with it at home","To look at ePad at home, check all the information available, watch those short videos ","Just to make it a little bit tidier.

I think I was one of the lucky ones who understood how to use pebblepad after our first session on it. I also took the time at home to look around the site and figure out where everything was. ,I would tell them to access the epad as soon as possible and get familiar with it before they go out on their first placement.,No changes required from my point of view,N/A
"I think I was relatively prepared, however I did forgot how to do certain things on ePad. I think the training session for it that we had was too long and too information giving to use at once. Additionally, the training was quite a while before we started placement so I forgot a lot of the information.",I would give them a physical document with information on so that they could have it visibly in front of them whilst working on their ePad with their mentor.,I think it could be made to look clearer and have less information on.,
I think that the sessions were really useful in smaller groups. I think it was explained really well by Tony as well as it possibly could be under the circumstances.,I wouldn't bother with the group lecture that includes all of the cohort. I would stick to the smaller group sessions as it allowed more focus and individual help than the PowerPoint lecture. ,"I would suggest that the placements tab be ordered with placement 2 first and then placement 3. 

I would also suggest doing more 'offline' things as access to computers can be hard when out on practice. 

I would also make the practice hours easier to log and instead of making attendance sheets there should be a pre-made sheet where you place your own details in.",Print screens/screen shots so you can refer back to this for yourself or mentors and they then have a visual guide. 
I think that the training sessions on epad where well structured and allowed me to gain a lot of knowledge of how to locate around epad. However i found it hard to use in practice and mentor was not given training ,tell them to go to the training sessions and to make sure there mentor knows how to use pebble pad befor starting placement ,None,Don't know

After this is was easy to use the tab menus. ,Take time to learn your way through the areas you need to input your placement information.,The placement layout is set up wrong as it doesn't start from the top tab.,Prompts to complete sections would be useful for students.
"I thought Tony organised a number of learning opportunities for ePad, of which I attended them all. This helped me considerably in finding my way around ePad. I found that the more I used it, the easier it got.",I think that some students worry as they think it is complicated. I thought that the learning sessions were very constructive and that students need reassuring that it is not as complicated as it seems. Unfortunately some people are very negative about change.,Some of the criteria for completing for year 2 and 3 were displayed on some year 1 forms. Maybe to keep each year on different forms so that forms for each particular year only have criteria for that year to be completed and signed off.,I am not sure. I cannot think of any.
I was anxious and worried about it more so when I found out that it was new to my mentor as well.,I think with support such as training and splitting students in groups will be effective again.,N/a,the NMC  guidance which is important for the students to remind us the importance of following it up.
I was not prepared at all and didn't really have a clue how to use it when I first went on placement. ,Definitely navigate around the site weeks before going on placement and learn to understand how to use it before your first placement. ,,
I was not well  prepared because we were only given a day's lecture about the pebble pad.  Moreover the mentors who supervised us on our placement could not understand issues on the epad.,The study of using epad should run alongside the normal lectures so that students will be well confident before going on placement.  Also the placement mentors need to update their skills and teach students when problems arise.,Allocate more lecture time for the teaching and learning of using epad.  Because the teaching of the use of epad was rushed through in meeting deadline for the placement.,Guidance on FAQ on epad and lectures from the university need to visit placement centres to resolve all questions instead of students calling or emailing problems.
"I was prepared enough to use it in placement, although my mentor had not heard of it. 

I think that its easier to get used to something when you use it regularly.","I think that should be clearer guidance on what additional information to include that can support the completion of standards.

It would be helpful to be fully aware of the benefits in using the pebble pocket app. ",,
"I was well prepared, the issues I faced were not based on any preparation I had received.",The same way.,"None, it is a good platform, at most it needs to consistently update - my pebblepad still hasn't updated with information from my mentor.","More guidance should be given for troubleshooting.

 

 

 

 

 

P.S. This questionnaire didn't give any room for feedback, so I'm putting it here.

My pebblepad did not work. Now whatsoever, it's now the 14th of May and it's literally just been completed. 

My mentor was unable to access my ePad, and the University was very slow to help when people were called. I still can not see any feedback from my mentor. It took until the end of my placement for my pebblepad to get fixed, and the support from the staff who are supposed to actually help fix the problem was hopeless.

Carine and my AST did a great job and actually fixed pebblepad."
"I wasn't prepared at first, however the many troubles arose from this experience brought me up to speed.",I would advise them to practice as much as possible.,The design of ePad is ok but its just the layout of the programme module in wrong order.  Year one programme should be in order. ,"make sure the correct date for the right programmes in order, example; all of year one's programmes are in the order that they should be complete

 Have someone directly to contact in case of problems and concerns.

 "
It took a while to understand how it worked but having to look at it in my own time I understood it a bit better and when I was with my mentor on placement we worked it out together as my mentor did not have any training on pebblepad. ,To keep playing around with it to understand it better. ,I would personally prefer a paper booklet to do it. ,To make sure all mentors in hospitals have training on it and also to make time when on placement to go through it with mentors as it's hard to take the time out on a ward to complete it. 
Looked at epad quite alot independantly before placement to get my head around it all.,The same as we were prepared. However the intoduction session to pebblepad made it look more complucated than it was.,"Make sure all mentors are familier with epad and are able to log on, as this caused delays.","None.

I found canvas easy to use once i started using it. So much you can do with it if had more time to put into it."
not,no need,nothing,nothing
not a great deal of preparation given but then again it was straight forward one i started using epad,tell them to play around with it and get use to it prior to going on placement.,place skills logs in correct order instead of having stage 2 below stage 3,
Not as well prepared as I would have liked to have been.,"Give them more time learning how to use it, especially on recording hours.",,
"Not at all, we had minimal instruction on how to use it,and many of us ended up having to figure it out for ourselves.","Read as much information as possible about how to use it, talk to other students on your placement about it, and above all ensure that your mentor(s) have access to it and know how to use it.",Make it a little easier to navigate and make the sections more clear i.e. show exactly which placement that particular section is for.,Who to contact if your mentor(s) are unable to access or use it.
Not comfortable at all. This is because my mentor wasn't aware of ,,,
"not completely prepared.

I feel as though the introduction sessions to epad were not structured in the most productive way. i feel as though some of the key points about which parts to tick and not tick were left out or not stressed enough. A simple and direct slide at the end of the power point may be useful. Again, i feel the sessions were very vague and not very informative however i understand it is very new!! ","Id make it alot more ""to the point"" and maybe leave a very direct powerpoint on canvas for us to refer to when in practice. 

Additionally, it would be good if the sessions are structured a little more strictly. I felt there was a fair bit of waffle and it may have needed a louder and more assertive lecturer to lead the sessions as it got derailed easily and people then got lost and uninterested. That in turn derailed the session and the rest of the points were lost in the mix.","Some of the documents would lock and you couldnt then go back and alter them which left alot of hassle, time wasting and of course last minute panic!

If the points could be expanded on it would be fantastic - even my mentor didnt know what they were so they were reluctant to sign them off. 

Some of the points we had to tick off , as a mental health nurse, were not really applicable. For example, we had to do work on the Glasgow Coma Scale which is never something we would use! maybe if the different fields would alter some of those points it would be great. i do however understand that we have to do the standard and basic nursing skills. 

 ",Just a more direct and structured piece of information would be fantastic which would offer its self as a self help guide :)

Not very well prepared. Both my mentor and myself had to figure out how it works from both ends. Even though we both had had training we still weren't confident enough with it out in practice. I had to reread the guides that are on canvas quite a few times. I also had to email to get my mentor onto my pebblepad to be told she needed to redo her pebblepad and then she could be unlocked. ,"I think it would be better presented in hourly sessions and going into depth on each part of ePAD. Such as attendances and absences, each placement form, the practice standards and skills logs and how to evidence them, as what we needed to evidence each standard wasn't made relatively clear. Also it would be good practice to inform students to keep paper copies of each evidence as well as technology can malfunction.","I don't like the layout of pebble pad at all. I think it needs condensing down in size as the pages and boxes are big. The bar across the top is not as easy to use as the burger bar down the size. The format of each page is gigantic and I think it needs simplifying rather than being made as big as what it is as it can get rather confusing. The assets would be better off being out in folders rather than just on the screen in a list as they don't go in order, just the last time you looked at the asset and made changes to it. To me it seems really unorganised and I would say pebblepad as a whole is in a really unorganised format.","What evidence is needed and how we can obtain this evidence. 

More explanation when it comes to practice standards and skills log as it is unclear what is expected. 

Explanation in how it is submitted as I had to email to ask how to submit it and I was told that it would auto submit on the day in question. 

 "
"Not very, attended all sessions and still wasn't 100%","Smaller group sessions, make sure the mentor also know how to use the system ","Be more open to people making mistakes! The attitude towards students made us feel like mistakes were unacceptable, when in fact they were inevitable when using a new system! 

Also a dummy system would be very advantageous as been told how to do something does not have the same effect as actually having a go.

The PowerPoints also showed you how to do something, there was no guide for if things go wrong. Which they did.",
"Not very, the sessions were rushed.",A small amount of information at a time. Too much was covered in the lecture and not enough in the computer room sessions. I think the lecture confused people more. It would have been better over a few small group sessions in computer rooms.,"Simplify it, like year 1, 2, 3. Then have separate sections for interviews with mentors on a separate tab. Also make it auto save for both students and mentors to the last updated version after each use. ","I feel there should be information for the mentors on there, so we can show them it, as a lot of complaints where that mentors hadn't had enough training and this affected the students."
Not very.,,,
Not very.,More training on Epad.,"Enable, automatic save.",Question and answers.
Not very. Although we had the session it wasn't clear what we had to do on placement.,Show them what they need to do on placement and how to fill it all out.,Automatic save.,Guidance for both students and mentors
"Not very. We were offered the session to go through it and I did attend it but so I don't feel the online pebblepad format is sufficient for assessment on placement. You do not always have access to a computer, it's complicated to use despite the session.","I wouldn't want to, it's not the best thing to use!",Go back to paper. Pebblepad is awful.,Go back to paper format. Canvas is easy to use though. 
"Ok, ","More practice, maybe a trial run and inputting session","Make sure mentors are willing and take the training session. It all ok training paying students, but when you have a mentor that can't be arsed you've kinda hit a brick wall! Sort the it department out it's ok having a contact email address, but a voice at the end of the phone is more helpful!",Direct contact number and helpline!
"one training session and one catch up session, which was ok but you have to use it live to really get into it",buddy them up with someone who has used it and timetable it in to the learning so it has to be attended ,"the most confusing thing is the banner across the top you have to scroll through, it is not user friendly please change it to a list view, it makes it easier to see what you have to do as a whole instead of half of your practice standards hiding along the banner.

 

spell check

 

dedicated team to help instead of one person handling all the queries ",i dont know what this 
plenty of training and opportunities to ask questions before placement ,The same and get them play around with epad before starting placement ,"Have all of year one on the same page rather than having to go in and out of different pages.

Not have to add up the hours as you go along for it to do it automatically.",none 
prepared,I will tell them that there is a tendency for it to go wrong and they should try to resolve whatever problems they encounter as quickly as possible,They should make the interface as easy to access from the home page as possible. The most important documents should be highlighted as well.,"How to use pad guidance for mentors on our page so that they can watch how to use it with us and we can talk them through as well. It is very awkward if the mentors have to log on to their epad and they are looking to us for guidance, which we cannot give because we don't know what they are expected to do."
prepared as we were given 2 lectures on how to use Epad,Having the same 2 lectures again but maybe working in smaller groups to explain how epad works. I think you should be given a user manual also.,"Being able to see all outcomes that need to be met clearly on one page, rather in separate tabs.",Guidance and examples of evidence that can be used to meet certain outcomes.What is excepted as evidence?
Quite prepared - I knew the basics ,Have a learning session closer to placement so that it's fresh in the mind,Nothing ,
Relatively prepared. ,Show them how to navigate around the system. Set up weekly timetable of hours.,,
Satisfactory.,"By a visual demonstration, such as a watching a video or a live tutorial.",Make the titles of pages less complicated and more simplistic.,I'm not sure.
Somewhat prepared. I attended the session which prepared me for the epad  and how I can use it. I felt confident enough with it to explain others how to use it too.,"I'd advise them to go on that 1 hour session for explaining how pebble  pad works, and play/use it often before going on to placement.",,
Staff prepared us for using epad to their best of their ability.It took practice to be able to use it effectively.,Epad sessions which we had.Give a booklet on how to use epad so they can take the booklet on placement to help them with completing epad.,I had problems with epad not saving my work even through I followed the instructions on how to save. which was frustrating for myself and my mentor.,
The lesson on using ,,,
"The tutorial sessions we had were very informative, and explained in depth how to use the service, however minor details about the time sheets were missed out and I had to source help.","I would tell them to not be afraid of it, and practice like i did before starting placement so you can use it with ease.","I would have liked the explanation of the time sheets on pebblepad to have been in more depth; I have never used one prior to this, and I needed guidence with filling it out.

 ",I felt as though it was sufficient.
The tutorials were informative and useful,Maybe smaller groups shown how to use it at a computer session. Maybe have some examples of current students epads so they know what to expect. Ideas of what to put in a box etc.,Adding up attendance and notification's on anything missed before hand in .,
"The whole process was very overwhelming, I didn't feel prepared at all really as the technology was so new and nobody seemed to have an idea how things worked with it.","Role play scenarios on Pebblepad which demonstrate a real life scenario of how to fill in items, what they will look like when comepleted, how much needs to say completed after each section, clarify stage 1, 2 and 3. ","I think that sections should be more grouped together. There should be opportunity to complete items for each placement under one tab. Attendance and absence aside, the rest could all be under one heading. For example. Year 1, year 2, year 3. ",
There was definitely lots of preparation given to us in order to use pebble pad. I didn't feel prepeared in myself but that's just because it was New and it was something I needed to get used to in order to feel confident with it in the future. ,Just to go on it often and have a play about with it to get used to it ready for when you go out onto placement. ,"Nothing, I think once everyone has gotten used to it it will be straight forward. Maybe  when going through it inncally though have smaller groups so the attention of questions and requirement of help on the computer can be given if needed.  ","Nothing, no more changes yet please! Need to get used to how it is first "
"They advised us at university, although i feel I needed a little more time on this as my mentor had not done any training with pebble pad, although my associate mentor had done some but was still not confident with it.","Perhaps introduce individual sessions for them if they where not sure, as many did not get chance to go over any problems with the lecture",more clarity and a more comprehensive help page,perhaps a little more structured as it appears confusing and it is worrying when you know you have dead lines to meet  
To start with it was quite daunting however after using it several times things clicked into place. ,"Encourage to use drop in sessions, and go to any tutorials available ","not sure, think this questionnaire would have been better filled in on last week of placement as part of the road documentation then it still would be fresh in my head. ",Do you mark page complete at end of placement or when the page is completely full. 
Very well,Maybe by giving a booklet for reminders when out on placement or at home,The skills log is the only thing that could be changed. This is due to the student not being able to write or tick anything on this section ,Guidance on how the reflection or comments should be written as from a students perspective we dont know if we are writing to much or not enough. And mentors do not know whether they are writing the right thing in the comments
Very well prepared .,"You did a good job showing students how to navigate around Epad, shame it couldn't be said about mentors .","Too many tabs, it Would be better if it could be put into one. Also it would be nice to have visibility of what we have completed, easier for both mentors (different placements) and students to see where you are with goals.",Not sure to be honest.
"Very well prepared. Found no issues using ePad. Though I am very IT literate, and some students are not. I was lucky my mentor understood how to use ePad, but other students on my placement had mentors which struggled to navigate it.","I would perhaps give them a mock run through of how to use it, filling in practice standard evidence forms and submitting them.",None.,N\A
Very well prepared  as I attended all sessions and drop-in sessions. ePad was explained and showed very well. ,The way we have been prepared has been good. I would possible use it for SFP in the same way it used in placements to help us get used to attaching evidence and so on. ,"A short clarification of some of the skills required - e.g. do we need to DO the skill or show we know how? 

Keeping year 2 and 3 standards/skills locked until required - it's pretty daunting! ",I think the guidance provided is excellent. 
We had a numerous of sessions on using ePad which i found helpful. Although i did not feel comfortable at first once you start using it you find it easier.,Make yourself familiar with the set up and what needs to be completed before going out into placement.,I think it is quite clear is the design but to add a page with advice for students so they are clear what they have to complete by the end of each year and contact numbers available on there too.,Advice for mentors and students as mentors do find pebble pad confusing.
"We were given opportunities to learn how to navigate and use epad which i appreciated but the problems we faced using it whilst in practice negated how well prepared i originally felt about using it. 

I have to say that in light of the problems over half the group experienced during our first placement, it was quite frustrating being told before our first placement that epad is ""a simple enough process and that we are adult learners"" so our epads are our responsibility.

Whilst I appreciate this sentiment, the process,  ""simple"" enough as it was,  clearly didn't work in the way it should. This was exacerbated by the fact that many of the mentors knew nothing about it.

It came across as conderscending and failed to acknowledge the fact that many people, a) don't necessarily feel confident in their IT  abilities (despite showing willingness to learn),  and b) that epad had never been used on a group that large before. 

 

 

 

 

 ","I think the main issue is making sure the mentors are prepared using it. Had we not had the issues we had I would have been alright using it thanks to the learning opportunities we had been given. My mentor on the other hand had never heard of it and didnt receive training until 2 weeks after my placment commenced. This was compounded by the fact she couldn't even get on it until help@hull or whoever intervened. 

 

 

 

 ","I would suggest blacking out the placement tabs that aren't relevant. I accidentally at one point started filling in the details for my placement in placement 3s boxes which was a pain. 

 

 

 ","I  know we were sent several emails with regards to getting support with epad so I would assume these would be on cavas also. I can't remember if this was the case but if not,  wack the details on there as well. 

 

 "
well prepared,by doing more teaching sessions,,
well prepared,lecture and teaching on ePad,not sure ,I thinks its easy once you have play around with it and get to grips on how to use it. if you do struggle with anything there is support.
"Well prepared from a technical/functional point of view. Very badly prepared from a CONTENT point of view. i.e what sort of thing to write on it, what constitutes evidence and what does not, how much to put on to each part.","It might have been useful to show us what came before (the paper doc). As I have never seen one of these I had no idea what sort of content went into a PAD doc. I would have done all the training ON a PC rather than any in a lecture hall. I would have a series of real life scenarios to work through with students one by one to give examples of how to use the system in real time.

eg. example 1. You have come to the end of your first week on placement. You are ready to complete your attendance sheet. you worked blah blah shifts and had one day out on a training course at humber centre. 3 of your shifts were spent with your mentor. Now complete and save the attendance form correctly

eg. example 2. You have spent a morning with the OT on community visits. use your pebblepad app to now record this and ask her to sign your app-now send it to your pebble pad and decide where to use this evidence.

eg. You were involved in an incident where you faced some challenging behaviour. You decide you want to write a reflection about this. (give an example of a suitable reflection). type this into p.pad and decide where would be good to use this as evidence

eg. You attend a Disability show. You collected lots of leaflets and info. Decide what from this material constiututes ""evidence"" and decide where on the standards/skills it could be used and put it on there

eg. You refer a community client to another service using a proforma. (have an example). Can you anonymise this and use it as evidence on you pebblepad and related to what standard?

So-I could go on and on-but basically, a workshop with real life examples-so showing examples of evidence and relevent stuff that can be used at the same time as learning where to use it and how to put it on.",,can't think of anything except examples of what constitutes evidence and examples of things correctly completed. I know you had no examples/have none but you could just make some up.
"well prepared in general, the lectures were clear and concise.",Inform them that mentors will need additional support.,"simpler design and user interface. The overall tool works well, however can be flawed as it can occasionaly not save edits or create duplicates of the main workbook.",mentor support notes
Well prepared.,I think the preparation we had was good. But during the placement I felt a bit unsupported when I had doubts and questions. Especially because it felt that if we made one mistake it could be a big problem for passing this module.,"I think the major problem with the epad is not related with the program. It is easy to use,once you play a bit with it. The major problem is that while in placement it is not easy to access it has there are not enough computers. You feel bad if you use you phone to work. It also makes it very difficult to be aware of what you have to achieve. And to communicate that to your mentors for them to help you.  Maybe   There should be a paper copy in each ward so that you can look at it and consult it. 

Another thing I would point I'd that there are loads of points you have to achieve and you loose the sense of how many because you only see some of this points in each page.

 ",I don't understand this question. What is the repository in Canvas?
Well prepared.,By encouraging them to use it frequently at their spare time so as to get use to it.,using paper forms also for backup to prevent unforseen circumstances..,Nil
"Without the session from Tony Chambers would wouldn't have stood a chance at EPAD, however I do think Epad was made out to be more complex than it actually was, as once you get used to it its pretty much straight forward.",I would do the same sessions as before but I would recommend you start training them earlier in it like September time so they have longer to get used to the system.,I would recommend you train the mentors better as when I was on placement some of the mentors had never heard of Pebblepad. I would also recommend you hold a range of training sessions for mentors as their wasn't enough for them and I make sure if your giving a student a mentor make sure they have a login nearly every mentor  on my ward didn't have a log in so the students had to email for them and that put delays on the initial and immediate interviews. I would also suggest you don't make pebblepad seem complicated as its really not but it came across that way and therefore students where completing the wrong sections and boxes.,I don't think it should all be on canvas I think more sessions should be held so students can have conversations with the session runners and get a better understanding. But I would put a few step by step explanations on canvas for those who cannot attend the sessions.
